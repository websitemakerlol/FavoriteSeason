<b><h3 style="color:RRBBGG;">I enjoy summer becasue the weather is pleasant and there is no school. Summer is very relaxing, and I love going on vacations. It is best to go to the beach in the summer because it is hot, and the ocean is refreshing. I love celebrating the Independence Day with my friends because we dress up and set off fireworks. I also love going to the pool and riding bikes with my friends. In the summer you can do many fun activities outside such as jet skiing, swimming, and playing sports. Overall, summer is super fun and relaxing. </h3>
